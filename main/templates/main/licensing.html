      <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
      <p>Uploaded data is held in the WHG database and visible only to the dataset creator unless and until it is flagged as "public," at which time it becomes discoverable (never editable) via our Search page and Database API. When a dataset is accessioned&mdash;a separate and distinct step from uploading&mdash;its records become accessible <i>in sets of close matches</i> via Search, and a separate Index API.</p>
      <p>All reasonable care is taken that the system will be available 24/7, and that uploaded data be preserved via regular backups, however we make no guarantees about access to the site and services or about contents held in the system;  nor do we accept any liability in case of loss of data. Users are encouraged to download and maintain copies of uploaded datasets if and when they have been augmented in the system.</p>
      
      <p>The World History Center at University of Pittsburgh provides free access to World Historical Gazetteer as a pilot and proof of concept for what we hope and expect will over time become an important element of the emerging linked historical data ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Upon registering, we require a name and valid email address, which we will never share without your explicit permission. We may <b><i>on occasion</i></b> notify registered users of changes to the system or pending downtime that could affect their use of it.</p>
