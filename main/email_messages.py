	'Thank you for registering for the World Historical Gazetteer (WHG). You can visit '
	            '<a href="https://whgazetteer.org/tutorials/guide/">the WHG site guide</a> '
	            'to learn more about services and features the platform provides.\n\n'
	'WHG is gathering contributions of place dataâ€”large and small, and for all regions and historical periods. '
	            'WHG provides services for geocoding place names, linking records for "closely matched" places, '
	            'and on request, publishing contributed datasets and user-created collections. '
	            'WHG is an excellent resource for teachers and students. Teachers can use its place information '
	            'to develop lessons and to make custom maps for presentation in lectures. \n\n'
	            'The "Place Collection" feature enables building and publishing sets of user-annotated place records, '
	            'accompanied by an explanatory essay, image, and links to external resources. '
	            'The WHG "union index" of place attestations drawn from multiple contributed datasets will over time '
	            'increasingly link the disparate research of contributors on the dimension of place. '
	            'Furthermore, by bringing together all the known references for a place without privileging '
	            'any particular one, it decenters colonial name making.\n\n'
	'We are accepting dataset and place collection contributions, which can be published on the site. '
