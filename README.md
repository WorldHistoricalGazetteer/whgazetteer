## World-Historical Gazetteer

This is the repository for the World-Historical Gazetteer (WHG) web platform and API. The project is based at the University of Pittsburgh's [World History Center](https://www.worldhistory.pitt.edu/), and has been substantially funded by the US National Endownment for the Humanities (NEH).

WHG is aggregating attestations of historical place references contributed by researchers. The Beta release v0.2 was made available on 28 October 2019. The codebase is Django and JavaScript, running on top of PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch data stores. More information on the project is available on [our blog website](http://whgazetteer.org).
